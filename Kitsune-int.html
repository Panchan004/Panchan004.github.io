        <h1><u><b>Kitsune:</b></u></h1>
        <p>Kitsune in the literal sense is the Japanese word for "fox". Foxes are a common subject of Japanese folklore; in English, kitsune refers to them in this context. Stories depict legendary foxes as intelligent beings and as possessing paranormal abilities that increase with their age and wisdom. According to Y≈çkai folklore, all foxes have the ability to shapeshift into human form. While some folktales speak of kitsune employing this ability to trick others as foxes in folklore often do other stories portray them as faithful guardians, friends, lovers, and wives.</p>

        <p>Foxes and humans lived close together in ancient Japan; this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto "kami," or "spirit," and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance.</p>

        <p>The more tails a kitsune has they may have as many as nine the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some people make sacrifices to them as to a deity.<br>
        Conversely foxes were often seen as "witch animals", especially during the superstitious Edo period (1603-1867), and were thought of as goblins who could not be trusted (similar to some badgers and cats).</p>
