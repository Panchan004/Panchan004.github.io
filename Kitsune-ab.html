      <h2><b>Abilities:</b></h2> 
      <h3><b>Fox-Fire:</b></h3> 
      <p>Their magic takes on a fiery effect, and in some stories is much like actual fire.</p>
      <h3><b>Shape-Shifting:</b></h3>
        <p>Kitsune are extremely intelligent and very powerful shape-shifters. They frequently harass humans by transforming into giants or other fearsome monsters, sometimes just for pranks, and sometimes for other nefarious purposes. They are skilled enough to even transform into exact likenesses of individual people, often appearing in the guise of beautiful human women in order to play tricks young men. On more than one occasion this has resulted in the marriage with an unwitting human. Some kitsune even spend most of their lives in human form, adopting human names and customs, taking human jobs, and even raising families. When startled, or drunk, or careless, occasionally part of their magical disguise can fail, and the kitsuneâ€™s true nature may be revealed by a tail, a patch of fur, fangs, or some other vulpine feature.</p>
