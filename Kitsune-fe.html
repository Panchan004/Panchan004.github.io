        <h2><b>Appearance:</b></h2>
        <p>Foxes, or kitsune, are found all across Japan, and are identical to wild foxes found elsewhere in the world, apart from their incredible magical powers. Their cute faces and small size make them particularly loved by most people.<br>
        Kitsune yokai, however, often have many tails. They can also be portrayed as bipedal. In human form, the Kitsune are known for being very attractive. There is one particularly famous kitsune known as <a href="https://mythus.fandom.com/wiki/Tamamo_no_Mae">Tamamo no Mae.</a></p>
        <br>
        <h2><b>Behaviour:</b></h2>
        <p>Kitsune are often portrayed as wild, occasionally wicked foxes, who delight in mischief, pranks, or evil. They are often seen as tricksters or sometimes even powerful sorcerers who use their abilities for evil. Even so, they are known to keep their promises, repay any debts, and remember friendships.</p>
